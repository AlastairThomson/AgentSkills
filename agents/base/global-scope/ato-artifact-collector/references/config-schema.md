# ATO Artifact Collector — Config Schema

This file describes the YAML configuration format read by Step 0 (Scope Selection)
of the `ato-artifact-collector` skill.

## File locations and precedence

Config is read from two places and merged **shallowly per source**:

1. **User defaults** — `~/.claude/skills/ato-artifact-collector/config.yaml`
   Used across every repository. Good place for tenant IDs, account numbers,
   default region lists — values that rarely change.
2. **Repo override** — `.ato-package.yaml` at the repo root.
   Per-repo scope. This file should be listed in `.gitignore` by default; the
   user can choose to commit it if their team shares scope across the whole
   repo.

**Merge rule: shallow per source.** If the repo file declares a `sharepoint:`
block, it fully replaces the user file's `sharepoint:` block — no deep merge,
no field-by-field overlay. This avoids surprises where a user's default site
list bleeds into a repo that deliberately scoped itself down.

If neither file exists, the skill prompts interactively in Step 0 and runs
repo-only if the user declines every external source.

## US-region allow lists

AWS and Azure scopes are validated against hard-coded US allow lists before
the sibling makes any API call. Any region not on these lists causes the
sibling to refuse the run with a specific error.

**AWS allow list**: `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-1`, `us-west-2`,
`us-gov-east-1`, `us-gov-west-1`.

**Azure allow list**: `eastus`, `eastus2`, `centralus`, `northcentralus`,
`southcentralus`, `westus`, `westus2`, `westus3`, `usgovvirginia`,
`usgovtexas`, `usgovarizona`, `usdodeast`, `usdodcentral`.

## Authentication configuration

Every source has its own `auth:` block (SMB uses `credentials_helper` at the
share level for historical reasons — same idea). The config **never stores
secrets**. What it stores is:

1. **Which method** the user has chosen to establish ambient auth on this host
   (device-code, browser-interactive, SSO profile, a local helper script,
   Kerberos, etc.).
2. **Non-secret parameters** for that method — a profile name, a tenant ID, an
   SSO start URL, a Keychain account hint, a path to a user-owned helper script.
3. **An optional `login_instruction` override** that the sibling echoes verbatim
   when it detects missing auth, instead of its built-in default. Use this to
   tell your team exactly how to log in in your environment ("run `./tools/ato-login.sh`"
   or "pull the break-glass creds from 1Password").

### Helper commands are user-owned

The Azure sibling's `helper_command` and any equivalent future hook is a path
to a **user-owned script or binary**. The sibling invokes it as a subprocess
and checks the exit code — it never reads the script's contents, never
inspects what it does, and never sees any credentials the script may touch.
This is how environment-specific flows (e.g. Alastair's `~/Applications/bin/azureauth`
that pulls creds from 1Password) plug in without the sibling skill needing to
know anything about 1Password.

If you don't have such a helper, use `method: device-code` or
`method: interactive` and let the native CLI handle the login flow directly.

### Service accounts vs personal credentials

SharePoint and AWS both support running under a shared service identity
instead of a personal account. The config doesn't enforce this — it's up to
whoever sets up the host that runs the collector. What the config does is:

- Let you set `method: service-account` (SharePoint) or `method: sso` with a
  dedicated read-only profile (AWS) so the intent is explicit.
- Let you set `account_hint` / `profile` so the Step 3 confirm screen shows
  *which* identity the sibling is about to act as. If the hint doesn't match
  what the probe returns, the sibling refuses to proceed.

## Worked examples

### Minimal — repo-only

No config file needed. The orchestrator prompts in Step 0; the user answers
"no" to every external source.

```yaml
# .ato-package.yaml  (optional — equivalent to no file at all)
version: 1
sharepoint: { enabled: false }
aws:        { enabled: false }
azure:      { enabled: false }
smb:        { enabled: false }
```

### Full — all four sources

```yaml
# .ato-package.yaml at repo root
version: 1

sharepoint:
  enabled: true
  tenant: contoso
  sites:
    - https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/app-ato
  libraries:
    https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/app-ato:
      - Documents
      - ATO Evidence
  folders:
    https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/app-ato:
      Documents:
        - /SSP
        - /POA&M
        - /Policies
      # 'ATO Evidence' library: no folder filter — scan the whole library

aws:
  enabled: true
  accounts: ["123456789012"]
  regions: [us-east-1]
  profile: ato-read
  services: [iam, config, cloudtrail, securityhub, s3]

azure:
  enabled: true
  subscriptions: ["11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"]
  resource_groups: [app-prod]
  regions: [eastus, usgovvirginia]

smb:
  enabled: true
  shares:
    - name: corp-ato
      unc: //fileserver.corp/ato
      mount_point: ~/mnt/corp-ato
      credentials_helper: kerberos
  depth: 3
```

## Merge example

User file `~/.claude/skills/ato-artifact-collector/config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
sharepoint:
  enabled: true
  tenant: contoso
  sites: [https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/global-policies]
aws:
  enabled: true
  accounts: ["999999999999"]
  regions: [us-east-1]
```

Repo file `.ato-package.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
sharepoint:
  enabled: true
  tenant: contoso
  sites: [https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/app-ato]
```

**Merged result** (repo's `sharepoint:` block fully replaces the user's;
`aws:` is inherited unchanged because the repo file didn't mention it):

```yaml
version: 1
sharepoint:
  enabled: true
  tenant: contoso
  sites: [https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/app-ato]   # repo wins entirely
aws:
  enabled: true
  accounts: ["999999999999"]                              # inherited from user
  regions: [us-east-1]
```

## `.gitignore` recommendation

Add this to the repo's `.gitignore` unless the team has deliberately chosen
to share the file:

```
# ATO artifact collector scope — may contain tenant-identifying info
.ato-package.yaml
```

## Ready-to-copy template

Save as `.ato-package.yaml` at the repo root and edit the values:

```yaml
version: 1

# Uncomment and fill in the sources you want to scan. Any section omitted or
# set to enabled:false will be skipped silently.

# sharepoint:
#   enabled: true
#   tenant: your-tenant                     # {tenant}.sharepoint.com
#   sites:
#     - https://your-tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/your-site
#   folders:
#     https://your-tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/your-site:
#       - /Shared Documents/ATO

# aws:
#   enabled: true
#   accounts: ["123456789012"]
#   regions: [us-east-1]                    # US allow list only
#   profile: your-sso-profile

# azure:
#   enabled: true
#   subscriptions: ["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"]
#   resource_groups: [your-rg]
#   regions: [eastus]                       # US allow list only

# smb:
#   enabled: true
#   shares:
#     - name: ato-shared
#       unc: //fileserver.corp/ato
#       mount_point: ~/mnt/ato-shared       # macOS/Linux only
#       credentials_helper: kerberos        # keychain | kerberos | prompt
#   depth: 3
```

## Validation rules

The orchestrator rejects a config that:

- Has a `version` other than `1`
- Declares an AWS or Azure region not on the US allow list
- Declares a `credentials_helper` other than `keychain`, `kerberos`, `prompt`,
  or `cmdkey`
- Declares an `auth.method` not on the per-source allow list (sharepoint:
  `device-code`|`interactive`|`service-account`|`existing`; aws: `sso`|
  `profile`|`env`|`instance`; azure: `device-code`|`interactive`|`helper`|
  `existing`)
- Sets `azure.auth.method: helper` without a `helper_command`, or sets
  `aws.auth.method: sso`/`profile` without a `profile`
- Sets `azure.auth.helper_command` to a path that doesn't exist or isn't
  executable by the current user
- Contains any field that looks like a stored secret (`password`, `token`,
  `client_secret`, `api_key`, `secret_access_key`, `refresh_token`, etc.) —
  these are forbidden; all auth is ambient. The Azure helper script IS allowed
  to touch secrets internally; the config file is not.
- Sets `vulnerability_scan.tools_allowlist` to a tool name not on the
  allow-list above (cargo-audit, npm-audit, pip-audit, safety, bundler-audit,
  govulncheck, dotnet-list, dependency-check, composer-audit, trivy, gitleaks,
  semgrep, osv-scanner)
- Sets `poam.severity_to_due_date` with a non-positive integer or a missing
  key from the canonical set {Critical, High, Moderate, Low}
- Has `sharepoint.enabled: true` but is missing `sharepoint.libraries`, OR has
  `sharepoint.libraries` keyed by a site URL not in `sharepoint.sites`, OR has
  `sharepoint.folders[site][library]` referring to a library not in
  `sharepoint.libraries[site]`. (Legacy `folders`-only configs with no
  `libraries` field are accepted with a deprecation warning — the SharePoint
  sibling defaults `libraries` to `["Documents"]` per site in legacy mode and
  treats each legacy folder string as `Documents/<path>`.)

On validation failure, the skill prints the offending field path and refuses
to proceed. The user fixes the config and re-runs.
