# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A collection of **multi-CLI AI skills and agents** for Claude Code, OpenCode, Kilo Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI. Skills (stateless step-by-step guides surfaced by description) live under `skills/`; agents (isolated-context subprocesses) live under `agents/`. Each agent is authored once in a CLI-agnostic base form and rendered to each CLI's native format at install time.

Both trees are split into **`global-scope/`** (user-level, installed once per CLI into each CLI's global directory — available in every repo) and **`repo-scope/`** (per-repo, installed by `skill-sync` into each CLI's per-repo directory only when the toolchain matches).

Repo layout:

```
skills/
  global-scope/      # workflow utilities that work on any repo
  repo-scope/        # toolchain-specific; pulled in by skill-sync
agents/
  base/              # canonical, CLI-agnostic agent source (body + metadata.yaml)
    global-scope/
    repo-scope/
  renderers/         # per-CLI transformers: claude.sh, opencode.sh, kilo.sh, gemini.sh, codex.sh
                     # + codex-agents-md.sh for the Codex AGENTS.md inventory
install.sh           # per-CLI installer with --for <cli>[,<cli>...]
CLAUDE.md            # this file
```

**Scope-selection rule.** A skill or agent belongs in `global-scope/` if it works usefully on any repo regardless of language (`deep-review`, `branch-review`, `bdd-audit`, `coverage-audit`, `repo-health`, `merge-sprint`, `skill-sync`, `skill-interview`, the ATO orchestrator + sources + remediation guidance + POA&M generator + vulnerability scanner, `auth-*`). It belongs in `repo-scope/` if it is meaningful only when a specific toolchain or target is present (language preflights, testing guides, `preflight` dispatcher, `deploy-app` + siblings, `ios-app-template-conventions`).

A paired stub and agent live in matching scopes — if the stub is global, the agent is too.

## CLI support

| CLI | Global agents dir | Global skills dir | Per-repo dir | Agent file | Identity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/agents/` | `~/.claude/skills/` | `<repo>/.claude/` | `<name>.md` (MD + YAML) | frontmatter `name:` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/agents/` | `~/.agents/skills/` (shared) | `<repo>/.opencode/` | `<name>.md` (MD + YAML, no name) | filename |
| Kilo Code | `~/.config/kilo/agents/` | `~/.agents/skills/` (shared) | `<repo>/.kilo/` | `<name>.md` (MD + YAML, no name) | filename |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/agents/` | `~/.agents/skills/` (shared) | `<repo>/.codex/` | `<name>.toml` + `AGENTS.md` | TOML `name =` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/agents/` | `~/.agents/skills/` (shared) | `<repo>/.gemini/` | `<name>.md` (MD + YAML) | frontmatter `name:` |
| Pi (pi.dev) | — *(no subagents)* | `~/.agents/skills/` (shared) | `<repo>/.pi/` and `<repo>/.agents/skills/` | `SKILL.md` only | frontmatter `name:` |

The installer (`install.sh --for <cli>[,<cli>...]`) and `skill-sync` both accept a multi-CLI selection. The user chooses which CLIs to install for; each selected CLI gets its own correctly-shaped copy of every agent (where applicable — Pi has only skills).

**Skill placement (strategy A — single canonical location, lean on cross-scan):** OpenCode, Kilo, Gemini, Codex, and Pi all auto-discover `~/.agents/skills/` as a cross-CLI compatibility location, so `install.sh` writes skills there once and lets those five CLIs pick them up. Claude is the only CLI that doesn't scan `~/.agents/`, so it gets its own `~/.claude/skills/`. Result: **at most two physical copies of any skill on disk regardless of how many CLIs are selected**, and no within-CLI duplicates — important for Codex specifically, which scans both `~/.codex/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/` and would surface every skill twice if we wrote to both.

**Pi has no subagents.** Pi (pi.dev) is a "minimal terminal coding harness" whose only customization mechanism is skills (loaded from `~/.pi/agent/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`). It has no Agent tool, no `subagent_type`, no equivalent to `~/.claude/agents/`. The installer skips agent rendering entirely for Pi (`cli_has_agents pi` returns false; `install_cli pi` short-circuits after the skills-dedup step). **Caveat:** thin-stub skills like `branch-review`, `deep-review`, `bdd-audit`, and `ato-artifact-collector` will surface in Pi (they're skills) but their bodies say "invoke the Agent tool with `subagent_type: <agent-name>`" — which Pi cannot do. Pi users who trigger one of those stubs will get a clear runtime error from Pi's harness; consider this a known limitation, not a bug. Skills that do their work inline (`coverage-audit`, `repo-health`, `auth-config`, `auth-interview`, the language preflights, etc.) work normally in Pi.

**Flat-only agent shape for OpenCode / Kilo / Gemini.** Those three CLIs recursively scan their `agents/` directory and register every `.md` file as an agent — including bundled `references/*.md`, which then surface as broken namespaced agents. To avoid that, the renderers for those CLIs **inline bundled references into the agent body** (via `_lib.sh::inline_references`) and the installer always writes them as flat `<name>.md` files. Claude and Codex preserve directory form because they don't have the same scanning trap.

## Skill anatomy

Every `skills/<name>/` directory contains a `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: <skill-name>
description: "One-line hook the harness uses to decide when to surface this skill."
---

# Human-readable title

Body: step-by-step instructions, tables, shell snippets.
```

- `name` is **required** and must match the directory name. Claude Code will fall back to the directory name if absent, but OpenCode, Kilo, Codex, and Gemini all require it explicitly per the agent-skills spec — keep it present so a single SKILL.md works across every CLI.
- `description` is **required** and is the field the harness matches against. Write it as a trigger sentence — lead with what the skill does, then when to use it. Keep it on a single line (Codex's loader has been observed to mishandle folded `>` and literal `|` YAML scalars in some versions); single-quoted scalars are the safe default. Description max length per the spec is 1024 chars.
- The directory name is the canonical skill identifier.
- Skills may carry supporting material in sibling folders (e.g. `references/`). Reference those from `SKILL.md` using relative paths.

## Agent anatomy

Agents live in a **base + renderer** pattern. The canonical source is CLI-agnostic; the renderers produce CLI-native files at install time.

Every `agents/base/<scope>/<name>/` directory contains:

```
agents/base/<scope>/<name>/
  agent.md              # prompt body — no frontmatter
  metadata.yaml         # canonical metadata (name, description, tools, model, extras.*)
  references/           # optional — copied verbatim for Claude/Codex; inlined into the rendered agent body for OpenCode/Kilo/Gemini
  evals/                # optional — copied verbatim for Claude/Codex; not installed for OpenCode/Kilo/Gemini
  config.yaml           # optional — copied verbatim for Claude/Codex; not installed for OpenCode/Kilo/Gemini
```

`metadata.yaml` shape:

```yaml
name: <agent-name>
description: "When the parent model should invoke this agent. Specific trigger language."
tools: [Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, Glob, Skill]
model: sonnet                                  # opus / sonnet / haiku / inherit
extras:                                        # optional per-CLI hints
  opencode:
    mode: subagent
  kilo:
    mode: subagent
  codex:
    sandbox_mode: read-only                    # or workspace-write for agents that write files
```

`model:` is authored using the canonical Claude aliases (`opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` / `inherit`). Only the Claude renderer emits the value verbatim — Claude understands those aliases natively. The OpenCode, Kilo, Gemini, and Codex renderers **drop the field** because each of those CLIs expects its own provider/model-id format and would reject a bare alias. Subagents inherit the invoker's model when `model:` is absent, which is the right default — the user picks the model in their CLI's global config rather than having every agent hard-code one.

At install time, each renderer at `agents/renderers/<cli>.sh` reads the agent's base directory and emits the CLI's native format:

- `claude.sh` / `gemini.sh` → Markdown with `name:` frontmatter
- `opencode.sh` / `kilo.sh` → Markdown without `name:` (filename is authoritative); adds `mode:`
- `codex.sh` → TOML with `developer_instructions = '''<body>'''`
- `codex-agents-md.sh` → `AGENTS.md` inventory listing every installed agent

**Agent shape per CLI:**

- **Claude / Codex** — agents that bundle `references/`, `evals/`, or `config.yaml` install as directory-form (`<cli-root>/agents/<name>/<name>.<ext>`) so the bundled files sit alongside the rendered agent. Simple agents land flat.
- **OpenCode / Kilo / Gemini** — always flat (`<cli-root>/agents/<name>.<ext>`), regardless of base shape. Those CLIs recursively scan their `agents/` directory and would register every reference `.md` as a broken namespaced agent. Bundled `references/*.md` are inlined into the rendered agent body via `_lib.sh::inline_references` so the agent stays self-contained; `evals/` and `config.yaml` are not installed for these CLIs (they are dev-loop artifacts, not runtime inputs).

**Shape rule:** the rendered frontmatter is CLI-specific, but the body (`agent.md`) is identical across CLIs. When editing an agent, edit `agent.md` — do not touch the rendered output in any CLI install tree. When adding a field that matters for only one CLI, put it under `extras.<cli>.` in `metadata.yaml` and teach that CLI's renderer to honor it.

## Skill ↔ agent pairing

A thin-stub skill often pairs with an agent. The stub triggers on user intent (preserving slash-command discoverability like `/branch-review`); the agent does the actual multi-step work in its own context. Current pairs:

| Stub skill | Agent | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/global-scope/deep-review/` | `agents/base/global-scope/deep-review/` | global |
| `skills/global-scope/branch-review/` | `agents/base/global-scope/branch-review/` | global |
| `skills/global-scope/bdd-audit/` | `agents/base/global-scope/bdd-audit/` | global |
| `skills/global-scope/coverage-audit/` | `agents/base/global-scope/coverage-investigator/` (optional; skill is usable without agent) | global |
| `skills/global-scope/ato-artifact-collector/` | `agents/base/global-scope/ato-artifact-collector/` | global |
| `skills/global-scope/ato-vulnerability-scanner/` | `agents/base/global-scope/ato-vulnerability-scanner/` | global |

`install.sh` installs every global-scope pair into each selected CLI's global directory, rendered per CLI. `skill-sync` handles repo-scope pairs (none today; reserved). Both share the `agents/base/` + `agents/renderers/` pattern.

## Skills and agents must be generic

Every directory under `skills/` or `agents/` is a **generic** artifact — safe to drop into any repo. No hardcoded crate names, project-specific paths, tenant names, or CLI tools that only exist in one product. If a command, path, or concept only makes sense for a specific downstream project, either genericize it (placeholders, framework-neutral examples) or keep it out of this repo. `ios-app-template-conventions/` is the one intentional exception — its description announces it as opinionated, so users opt in knowingly.

## Skill categories

**Global-scope** (`skills/global-scope/`, `agents/global-scope/`):

- **Audit / review** — stub+agent pairs `bdd-audit/`, `branch-review/`, `deep-review/`, and skill `coverage-audit/` (optionally paired with `coverage-investigator` agent); `repo-health/`
- **Batched-PR workflow** — `merge-sprint/`
- **Per-repo provisioning** — `skill-sync/`, `skill-interview/`
- **Credentials** — `auth-config/` (resolver — reads `~/.agent-skills/auth/auth.yaml`, runs user's vault CLI, validates session) and `auth-interview/` (AskUserQuestion-driven bootstrap of the config file, 0600 on write)

**Repo-scope** (`skills/repo-scope/`):

- **Preflight dispatcher** — `preflight/` (detects toolchains and delegates via the Skill tool to the matching sibling)
- **Language preflight siblings** — `cargo-preflight/` (Rust), `xcode-preflight/` (Swift + Objective-C), `python-preflight/`, `node-preflight/` (TypeScript + JavaScript), `jvm-preflight/` (Java + Kotlin), `go-preflight/`, `ruby-preflight/`, `dotnet-preflight/` (C#), `cmake-preflight/` (C + C++), `php-preflight/`, `data-script-preflight/` (SQL + R + SAS + Perl)
- **Testing guides** — `rust-testing/`, `swift-testing/`, `python-testing/`, `node-testing/`, `jvm-testing/`
- **Project conventions templates** — `ios-app-template-conventions/` (opt-in; one team's Swinject + Swift Testing + FileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup + Backups stack)
- **Ops / deployment** — `deploy-app/` (dispatcher), `native-app-deploy/`, `web-app-deploy/`, `container-app-deploy/`

`agents/base/repo-scope/` is currently empty and reserved for repo-scoped agents.

`preflight` is the dispatcher — it invokes the matching `*-preflight` sibling via the Skill tool, with an inline fallback for unrecognized toolchains. When adding a new language-specific preflight, (1) wire it into `skills/repo-scope/preflight/SKILL.md`'s marker table, (2) add a matching row to `skills/global-scope/skill-sync/SKILL.md`'s detection table, and (3) keep the sibling's description prefixed `"Pre-PR checklist for <language>:"` so the harness disambiguates cleanly.

## ATO orchestrator + sibling pattern

The ATO orchestrator lives as an **agent** at `agents/base/global-scope/ato-artifact-collector/`, fronted by a thin stub skill at `skills/global-scope/ato-artifact-collector/`. The orchestrator coordinates six siblings, all under `skills/global-scope/` (one is paired with an agent — see "Sibling shapes" below):

- **Source siblings** (4 read-only collectors): `ato-source-aws`, `ato-source-azure`, `ato-source-sharepoint`, `ato-source-smb`. Each runs when the user enables the corresponding external scope (AWS, Azure, SharePoint/M365, SMB shares).
- **Vulnerability scanner** (`ato-vulnerability-scanner`): a 5th source, but shaped as **agent + thin stub** (the only sibling shaped that way). Runs in Step 1.5 (between Orient and Discover) by default; the user can disable per-run with `--no-vuln-scan` or per-host via `vulnerability_scan.enabled: false` in config.
- **Remediation guidance** (`ato-remediation-guidance`): produces `REMEDIATION_GUIDANCE.md` post-collection. Runs only when the user explicitly asks, OR when the user invoked the orchestrator with `--remediation` / `--poam` (the stub flips an `auto_remediation` flag in the scope object).
- **POA&M generator** (`ato-poam-generator`): produces `poam-generated.md/.csv` post-remediation. Runs only when the user explicitly asks, OR when the user invoked the orchestrator with `--poam` (which implies `--remediation`). Consumes the remediation output, vulnerability findings, and CHECKLIST gaps.

The orchestrator's stub skill (`skills/global-scope/ato-artifact-collector/SKILL.md`) accepts CLI-style flags (`--repo / --aws / --azure / --sharepoint / --smb / --no-vuln-scan / --no-assessment / --no-synthesize / --accept-synthesized / --remediation / --poam`) that bypass the interactive scope-confirmation interview. Any source flag triggers skip-interview mode; unflagged sources are disabled. The flags compose: `--poam` implies `--remediation`; both can combine with any source set. `--no-assessment` disables Steps 6.5/6.6 (Findings/Result skipped, CSV becomes 7-column). `--no-synthesize` disables Step 6.6 only. `--accept-synthesized` auto-promotes synthesized drafts up one folder, flips Result to Satisfied, and emits loud signaling (end-of-run summary, INDEX.md banner, CHECKLIST notes column).

The full hand-off contract for the source siblings is documented in `agents/base/global-scope/ato-artifact-collector/references/sibling-contract.md` — read it before editing any source sibling. Invariants the source siblings all share:

- **Read-only.** No `create-*`, `put-*`, `delete-*`, `modify-*`, or any write verb. If asked to remediate, refuse and escalate.
- **Ambient auth only.** Siblings never store credentials, never call `aws configure`, never touch `~/.aws/credentials` etc. They use whatever session the user already established via the native tool.
- **Scope-confirmed in-session.** Each sibling re-confirms its scope before making external calls; the orchestrator does not bypass that prompt.
- **Graceful degradation.** If a sibling fails (auth missing, scope declined), the orchestrator records the failure and continues with remaining sources. Repo-only runs are a first-class mode.

The same invariants apply to `ato-vulnerability-scanner` (read-only on the repo, never auto-installs missing tools, gracefully degrades when scanners are absent, treats external advisory text as untrusted data).

### Sibling shapes

Five of the six siblings are **skills**: `ato-source-{aws,azure,sharepoint,smb}` and `ato-remediation-guidance` and `ato-poam-generator`. They are invoked by the orchestrator agent via the Skill tool. `ato-vulnerability-scanner` is the exception — it is an **agent + thin stub skill** (same pattern as `branch-review`, `deep-review`, `bdd-audit`) because it runs many external tools, parses verbose JSON, and benefits from an isolated context. The orchestrator invokes it via `Skill: "ato-vulnerability-scanner"`; the skill stub delegates to the agent. Standalone invocation works the same way (the skill is user-facing).

Source siblings write evidence into one of two top-level branches under `docs/ato-package/`: `ssp-sections/<NN>-<slug>/evidence/<source>_<file>` for document-shaped artifacts (the SSP body, IRP, CP, CMP, ConMon plan, ISA/MOU, POA&M, etc.) or `controls/<CF>-<slug>/evidence/<CONTROL-ID>/<source>_<file>` for per-control implementation evidence (an IAM role for AC-2, an NSG rule for SC-7, a CloudTrail config for AU-2, etc.). `<NN>` is the SSP-section ordinal (01–14), `<CF>` is the two-letter NIST 800-53 Rev 5 control-family code (all 20 always present: AC, AT, AU, CA, CM, CP, IA, IR, MA, MP, PE, PL, PM, PS, PT, RA, SA, SC, SI, SR), and `<CONTROL-ID>` is the specific control or enhancement (`AC-02`, `AC-02(04)`). Citation batches go to `docs/ato-package/.staging/{source}-citations.json` (where `{source}` ∈ `sharepoint | aws | azure | smb | vulnscan`; `vulnscan` is the sixth source token, peer to the cloud/share four). The canonical SSP-section + family table and the old-slug → new-path migration map live in `agents/base/global-scope/ato-artifact-collector/agent.md` under "File naming convention".

**Sub-control granularity (Steps 4.5/4.6/6.5/6.6/6.7).** The orchestrator iterates at the **Determine If ID** level — sub-letters of the control body (`AC-02(a)`–`AC-02(l)`), enhancements (`AC-02(01)`), and enhancement-with-sub-letter chains (`AC-02(12)(b)`). Step 4.5 builds `.staging/sub-control-inventory.json` listing every Determine If ID per in-scope control. Step 4.6 emits per-Determine-If-ID `_relevant-evidence.md` manifests at `controls/<CF>-<slug>/evidence/<CONTROL-ID>/<DETERMINE-IF-ID>/`; manifests reference parent-level evidence files by relative path (no file duplication within a family). Step 6.5 (assessment pass) generates a Findings paragraph + Result (Satisfied / NotSatisfied / blank) for every Determine If ID, comparing the implementation narrative against the requirement text. Step 6.6 (synthesis) generates draft artifacts under `synthesized/` for "implementation present, artifact missing" gaps (e.g., the AC-02(d) role matrix); when `--accept-synthesized` is set, drafts auto-promote up one folder with loud signaling. Step 6.7 emits a 9-column GRC CSV per family (`controls/<CF>-<slug>/<cf>-assessment.csv`) plus a master CSV (`controls/_master-assessment.csv`) with header `Family ID,Family,Control ID,Control,Determine If ID,Determine If Statement,Method,Result,Findings`. See `references/sub-control-enumeration.md`, `references/assessment-template.md`, `references/synthesis-patterns.md`, and `references/csv-schema.md` for the full schemas. Siblings remain control-level (do not write into per-Determine-If-ID sub-folders).

`ato-remediation-guidance` and `ato-poam-generator` are read-only on the existing package. `ato-remediation-guidance` writes exactly one new file (`docs/ato-package/REMEDIATION_GUIDANCE.md`). `ato-poam-generator` writes three (`ssp-sections/04-poam/poam-generated.md`, `ssp-sections/04-poam/poam-generated.csv`, and `controls/CA-assessment-authorization/evidence/CA-5/poam-generated.md`). Neither is part of the default 8-step workflow; both share none of the source-sibling auth or scope-confirmation flow — their only inputs are the package on disk and the working repo.

## Editing conventions

- **File casing:** Skills use `SKILL.md` (uppercase). Agents use `agent.md` (under `agents/base/<scope>/<name>/`). Keep this consistent — mixed casing works on macOS but would break on a case-sensitive filesystem.
- **`metadata.yaml` must stay valid YAML.** A renderer will fail if frontmatter parses oddly. Keep `description:` as a single-line quoted string.
- **Never commit per-CLI-rendered output.** Agent changes land in `agent.md` + `metadata.yaml` under `agents/base/`. The CLI-specific output is generated by the installer; do not hand-edit it.
- **Shell snippets in skill / agent bodies are contracts**, not examples — users will copy-paste them. When you change a command, verify it still runs on the toolchain it targets.
- **When editing a paired stub skill or its agent, check both.** The skill's description and the agent's description must stay coherent — the skill is what triggers, the agent is what runs.
- **When adding a new CLI:** add `agents/renderers/<cli>.sh`, teach `install.sh` about its target root and file extension, add a row to the CLI-support table above, and add a case to `skill-sync`'s per-CLI install loop.
- The repo has no root-level `README.md`; the skill corpus is its own documentation. Don't create one unless asked.

## Working with the `repo/` sandbox

If a task mentions `x3f-*` crates, `cargo`, or anything Rust-shaped, you are almost certainly in `repo/` — `cd` there and follow its own `CLAUDE.md`. Changes to the sandbox are not changes to the skills and should not land in the same commit.
