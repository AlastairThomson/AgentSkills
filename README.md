# AgentSkills

A curated collection of **multi-CLI AI skills and agents** — drop-in capabilities for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [Kilo Code](https://kilo.ai), [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex), and [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com). Each agent is authored once in a CLI-agnostic base form and rendered to each CLI's native format at install time; you pick which CLI(s) to install for.

The tree is split into **global-scope** (user-level, installed once per CLI into each CLI's global directory — available in every repo) and **repo-scope** (per-repo, installed by [`skill-sync`](skills/global-scope/skill-sync/SKILL.md) into each CLI's per-repo directory only when the toolchain matches). Instead of installing everything globally and hoping the harness picks the right one, repo-scope artifacts land only in the repos that actually need them.

## CLI support

| CLI | Global dir | Per-repo dir | Agent file |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/` | `<repo>/.claude/` | `<name>.md` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/` | `<repo>/.opencode/` | `<name>.md` |
| Kilo Code | `~/.config/kilo/` | `<repo>/.kilo/` | `<name>.md` |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/` | `<repo>/.codex/` | `<name>.toml` + `AGENTS.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/` | `<repo>/.gemini/` | `<name>.md` |

Claude Code additionally gets skills (`~/.claude/skills/` + `<repo>/.claude/skills/`); the other CLIs handle skill-like content differently and are agent-only today.

**Skills** are stateless step-by-step guides the Claude Code harness surfaces by description. They're how you teach Claude Code "when the user says X, do Y."

**Agents** are isolated-context subprocesses invoked via the `Agent` tool. They handle multi-step investigations without polluting the parent conversation.

**Scope-selection rule.** A skill / agent lives in `global-scope/` if it works on any repo regardless of language (`deep-review`, `branch-review`, `bdd-audit`, `coverage-audit`, `repo-health`, `merge-sprint`, `skill-sync`, `skill-interview`, `auth-config`, `auth-interview`). It lives in `repo-scope/` if it is meaningful only when a specific toolchain or target is present.

Some skills are **thin stubs paired with an agent** — the skill triggers on user intent (preserving slash-command discoverability like `/branch-review`); the agent does the work in its own context. Paired stubs and their agents always live in matching scopes:

| Stub skill | Agent | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `deep-review` | `deep-review` | global |
| `branch-review` | `branch-review` | global |
| `bdd-audit` | `bdd-audit` | global |
| `coverage-audit` | `coverage-investigator` (optional) | global |
| `ato-artifact-collector` | `ato-artifact-collector` | global |

`install.sh` installs every global-scope pair into each selected CLI's global directory, rendered per CLI. `skill-sync` handles repo-scope pairs (none today). Both share the `agents/base/` + `agents/renderers/` pattern.

## Catalog

All 37 skills and 5 agents, grouped by purpose. **Scope** indicates whether the artifact is installed globally per CLI (global) or per-repo via `skill-sync` (repo). **How to use** lists the detection marker (for repo-scope skills) or the natural-language trigger the harness listens for.

### Provisioning _(all global-scope)_

| Skill | What it does | Dependencies | How to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skill-sync` | Detects toolchains, fetches the matching subset of `repo-scope/` skills + agents from the source repo, writes `.sync-manifest.json` for idempotent re-runs | `gh` or git over SSH + `~/.claude/skill-sync.config.yaml` | Trigger: "skill-sync", "install skills for this repo" |
| `skill-interview` | Greenfield: interviews the user about languages / frameworks / deploy targets, then delegates to `skill-sync` | `AskUserQuestion` + `skill-sync` | Trigger: "new repo", "set up skills for a fresh project" |

### Credentials _(all global-scope)_

| Skill | What it does | Dependencies | How to use |
|---|---|---|---|

| `ios-app-template-conventions` | One team's iOS / macOS stack: Swinject DI, Swift Testing (never XCTest), `FileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`, `Backups/` folder for deletes | Xcode 16+, Swinject, Swift Testing | **Opt-in only** — install per-project for repos that follow the template. Not a universal Swift guide. |

### Agents (invoked via the `Agent` tool)

| Agent | What it does | Scope | Tools | How to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deep-review` | Eight-axis review orchestrator — feature integrity, stubs/dead code, user journey, test honesty, security + full threat model (incl. LLM + agent-to-agent attack paths), reliability, ship hygiene, doc↔code. Spawns parallel Explore sub-agents, enforces submission gate | global | Bash, Read, Write, Grep, Glob, Agent | Invoked by the `deep-review` stub skill |

| `coverage-investigator` | Deep dive on a single low-coverage file/module: classifies each uncovered entry point (pure / injectable / hard-wired / dead / integration-only), estimates effort, recommends next action. **Read-only.** | global | Bash, Read, Grep, Glob | Invoked by `coverage-audit` when the user asks "why is this file low?" |
| `ato-artifact-collector` | 8-step NIST 800-53 evidence-collection orchestrator. Produces `docs/ato-package/` with 20+ evidence families, narrative docs with `[CR-NNN]` citations, `INDEX.md` + `CHECKLIST.md` + `CODE_REFERENCES.md` | global | Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Skill | Invoked by the `ato-artifact-collector` stub skill after scope is confirmed |

## Quick start

### 0. Install the global-scope skills + agents for your CLI(s)

**One-liner for a single CLI** (no clone required):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlastairThomson/AgentSkills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --for claude
```

**Install for several CLIs at once:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlastairThomson/AgentSkills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --for claude,opencode,kilo
```

What happens: the installer fetches the repo tarball at `main` (or whatever `--ref` you pass). For each CLI in `--for`, every agent under `agents/base/global-scope/` is piped through the matching renderer (`agents/renderers/<cli>.sh`) to produce the CLI's native format, then written to that CLI's global directory (`~/.claude/`, `~/.config/opencode/`, `~/.config/kilo/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.gemini/`). Claude additionally gets `skills/global-scope/*` under `~/.claude/skills/`. Codex additionally gets an `AGENTS.md` inventory. A single manifest at `~/.agent-skills/installer-manifest.json` tracks everything so subsequent runs are idempotent. Artifacts you authored by hand are never touched — only ones listed in the manifest.

**No `--for`?** If stdin is a TTY the installer will prompt multi-select. In a non-TTY pipe, `--for` is required (no silent default).

**Pin a specific version** (recommended for teams):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlastairThomson/AgentSkills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --for claude --ref v1.0.0
```

**Inspect before installing:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlastairThomson/AgentSkills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --for claude --list
```

**Uninstall:**

```bash
# Remove everything installed:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlastairThomson/AgentSkills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall

# Or just one CLI:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlastairThomson/AgentSkills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall --for claude
```

**All flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--for <list>` | Comma-separated CLIs: `claude`, `opencode`, `kilo`, `codex`, `gemini`. Multi-select TTY prompt if omitted; required in non-TTY mode. Also `AGENT_SKILLS_FOR`. |
| `--ref <branch\|tag\|sha>` | Pin to a specific revision. Default: `main`. Also `AGENT_SKILLS_REF`. |
| `--repo <owner/name>` | Pull from a fork instead. Default: `AlastairThomson/AgentSkills`. Also `AGENT_SKILLS_REPO`. |
| `--dest <dir>` | Override install root — each CLI installs under `<dir>/<cli>/`. Useful for sandboxed testing. Also `AGENT_SKILLS_DEST`. |
| `--from <dir>` | Install from a local checkout instead of fetching (development / smoke testing). |
| `--list` | Print what would be installed; write nothing. |
| `--uninstall` | Remove manifest-listed artifacts. Combine with `--for` to target one CLI. |
| `--keep-cache <dir>` | After install, move the extracted repo to `<dir>` for offline re-use. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip the interactive confirmation (required under `curl \| bash` without a TTY — pass `-y` in that case). |

After install, `skill-sync`, `skill-interview`, `repo-health`, `branch-review`, `bdd-audit`, `coverage-audit`, `merge-sprint`, `deep-review`, `auth-config`, `auth-interview`, and the ATO family are available in every repo without further install (for Claude Code — other CLIs get the agents only, not the skills).

**Kilo cross-scan note.** Kilo by default scans `.claude/`, `.opencode/`, and `.agents/` directories in addition to its own. If you install for Kilo *only* (`--for kilo`), the installer prints instructions to isolate Kilo from those other directories. If you install for Kilo alongside other CLIs, cross-scan is left enabled (assumption: you want visibility).

**Prefer a full clone?** Fine — `git clone`, then `./install.sh --for <cli>` from the checkout. Same result, same manifest.

**Optional next step — credentials.** If any repo you work in will use the ATO source skills (AWS, Azure, SharePoint, SMB) or a multi-model agent framework that needs LLM API keys, run `auth-interview` once to bootstrap `~/.agent-skills/auth/auth.yaml`. The interview asks where each credential lives (1Password, Bitwarden, Keychain, Vault, env var, or a custom script) and writes the config with `chmod 0600`.

### 1. One-time config at `~/.claude/skill-sync.config.yaml`

```yaml
version: 2
source:
  repo: AlastairThomson/AgentSkills   # or your fork
  ref: main                            # prefer a pinned tag in production
target_clis: []                        # empty = inherit from ~/.agent-skills/installer-manifest.json
                                       # else list: claude, opencode, kilo, codex, gemini
allowlist: []                          # empty = any skill in source is eligible
deny: []
auth:
  method: gh                           # gh | ssh — uses ambient auth
```

### 2. From inside the target repo, ask your AI CLI to run `skill-sync`

It will:

1. Resolve which CLIs to configure (from `target_clis:`, the installer manifest, or a TTY prompt).
2. Detect the repo's toolchains (Cargo.toml, package.json, Package.swift, …) and workflow signals (Dockerfile, …).
3. Fetch the matching subset of **repo-scope** artifacts from this repo (global-scope artifacts are already in each CLI's global directory from step 0).
4. For each selected CLI, render agents through `agents/renderers/<cli>.sh` and install into `<repo>/.<cli>/`.
5. Write a `.sync-manifest.json` so subsequent runs are idempotent.
6. Ask once whether the per-CLI directories should be committed to git or gitignored, and edit `.gitignore` accordingly.

**Greenfield project with no code yet?** Use `skill-interview` instead — it asks about intended languages/frameworks, then delegates to `skill-sync`.

**Subsequent runs:**

| Invocation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `skill-sync` | Apply: detect, diff, install, prune, write manifest |
| `skill-sync --dry-run` | Detect and print the diff; touch nothing |
| `skill-sync --status` | Report drift vs. the manifest; exit non-zero if drift exists |
| `skill-sync --prune` | Remove manifest-listed skills no longer selected |
| `skill-sync --force-update` | Treat all manifest entries as "to update" |

## Skill anatomy

```markdown
---
description: "One-line hook the harness uses to decide when to surface this skill."
---

# Human-readable title

Body: step-by-step instructions, tables, shell snippets.
```

- `description` is the only field the harness matches against — write it as a trigger sentence.
- The directory name is the canonical skill identifier.
- Supporting material (tables, checklists) lives in sibling folders and is referenced by relative path.

## Agent anatomy

Agents are authored in a CLI-agnostic base form and rendered per CLI at install time. Each agent lives in `agents/base/<scope>/<name>/`:

```
agents/base/<scope>/<name>/
  agent.md          # prompt body — no frontmatter
  metadata.yaml     # canonical metadata (see below)
  references/       # optional — copied verbatim into every CLI install
  evals/            # optional
  config.yaml       # optional
```

`metadata.yaml`:

```yaml
name: <agent-name>
description: "When the parent model should invoke this agent."
tools: [Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, Glob, Skill]
model: sonnet
extras:                        # optional per-CLI hints
  opencode:
    mode: subagent
  kilo:
    mode: subagent
  codex:
    sandbox_mode: read-only
```

When `install.sh` or `skill-sync` installs an agent for a given CLI, it runs `agents/renderers/<cli>.sh` on the base directory and writes the rendered file to the CLI's native location with the right frontmatter (or TOML, for Codex). Never hand-edit the rendered output — edit `agent.md` + `metadata.yaml` in the base tree, then re-run the installer.

## Contributing

Everything under `skills/` and `agents/` must be **generic** — safe to drop into any repo. No hardcoded crate names, tenant names, or single-product CLI tools. The one intentional exception is `ios-app-template-conventions`, whose description announces it as opinionated.

When adding a new skill or agent, pick the scope:

- `global-scope/` — works usefully against any repo, regardless of language. Typical candidates: audit/review, VCS workflows, user-level provisioning tooling.
- `repo-scope/` — only makes sense in the presence of a specific toolchain, target, or workflow file. Language preflights, testing guides, deployment siblings, compliance orchestrators.

A paired stub skill and its agent must live in matching scopes.

When you add a new language-specific preflight:

1. Wire it into `skills/repo-scope/preflight/SKILL.md`'s marker table.
2. Add a matching row to `skills/global-scope/skill-sync/SKILL.md`'s detection table.
3. Prefix the description with `"Pre-PR checklist for <language>:"` so the harness disambiguates cleanly.

When you add a new CLI:

1. Add `agents/renderers/<cli>.sh` (see existing renderers as templates; source `_lib.sh` for YAML helpers).
2. Add a golden assertion block to `agents/renderers/tests/smoke.sh`.
3. Teach `install.sh` about the CLI's target root (`cli_root()`), file extension (`cli_agent_ext()`), and the `SUPPORTED_CLIS` list.
4. Add a row to the CLI-support table in this README and in `CLAUDE.md`.
5. Add a per-CLI branch to `skill-sync`'s install loop.

Full contributor conventions — file casing, frontmatter rules, the skill↔agent pairing contract, the ATO orchestrator/sibling invariants — live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
