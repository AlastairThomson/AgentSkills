name: ato-artifact-collector
description: "Collect, generate, and index NIST 800-53 security artifacts from a code repository for federal ATO (Authority to Operate) package preparation. Use whenever the user mentions ATO, NIST 800-53, security package, SSP artifacts, FedRAMP evidence collection, compliance artifacts, security documentation gathering, ATO readiness, compliance gaps, or security documentation completeness for a federal system. Even a casual 'collect security artifacts' or 'what do I need for my ATO' should trigger this skill. Accepts CLI-style flags (--repo / --aws / --azure / --sharepoint / --smb / --no-vuln-scan / --remediation / --poam) to bypass the interactive scope-confirmation interview; falls back to the interview when no source flags are present. Confirms scope, then delegates the multi-step collection to the ato-artifact-collector agent."

# ATO Artifact Collector

This skill is a thin launcher for the `ato-artifact-collector` agent. The agent runs an 8-step workflow that reads dozens of files, invokes sibling skills for external sources (AWS / Azure / SharePoint / SMB), runs a pre-collection vulnerability baseline, and writes 20+ evidence directories plus a `CHECKLIST.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `CODE_REFERENCES.md`. That volume of work belongs in an isolated agent context, not the main conversation.

## Step 0 — Parse flags from `$ARGUMENTS`

Before doing anything else, parse the user's invocation arguments for the following flags. The grammar is one or more space-separated `--<flag>` tokens; flags carry no values.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--repo` | Mark repo scope explicitly. (Repo is always implied; this flag is for documentation.) |
| `--aws` | Enable the AWS source. Skip the AWS y/N prompt. Requires ambient `aws` CLI auth and `ato-source-aws` installed. |
| `--azure` | Enable the Azure source. Skip the Azure y/N prompt. Requires ambient `az` CLI auth and `ato-source-azure` installed. |
| `--sharepoint` | Enable the SharePoint / M365 source. Skip the SharePoint y/N prompt. Requires ambient `m365` CLI auth and `ato-source-sharepoint` installed. |
| `--smb` | Enable the SMB / Windows-share source. Skip the SMB y/N prompt. Requires mount helpers and `ato-source-smb` installed. |
| `--no-vuln-scan` | Disable the pre-collection vulnerability scan. By default the scan runs every collection (between Step 1 and Step 2 of the agent workflow). |
| `--no-assessment` | Disable the per-Determine-If-ID assessment pass (Step 6.5) AND synthesis (Step 6.6). The orchestrator still emits the `<cf>-implementation.md` family narrative with H3 sub-sections + Determine If Statement, but skips Findings/Result and emits a 7-column CSV (no `Result`/`Findings` columns) instead of the 9-column GRC default. |
| `--no-synthesize` | Disable gap-driven artifact synthesis (Step 6.6) only. Findings + Result are still produced (assessment runs); gaps are named textually but no drafts are written and no `SYNTHESIZED_ARTIFACTS.md` inventory is produced. |
| `--accept-synthesized` | Auto-promote each synthesized draft from `synthesized/<artifact>.md` to `evidence/<CONTROL-ID>/<DETERMINE-IF-ID>/<artifact>.md` (one folder up); flip Result to Satisfied for that Determine If ID; emit loud signaling (end-of-run summary block, `INDEX.md` banner, `CHECKLIST.md` notes column). The original drafts stay under `synthesized/` for audit. **Risky** — synthesized drafts make assertions about the system from code inspection alone, and may disagree with org policy. The loud signaling is the safeguard; review every promoted artifact before authoritative submission. |
| `--remediation` | Auto-invoke `ato-remediation-guidance` after Step 8 completes. Without this flag, remediation guidance runs only when the user explicitly asks afterward. |
| `--poam` | Auto-invoke `ato-poam-generator` after the remediation step. **Implies `--remediation`** (POA&M generation consumes the remediation output). If the user passes `--poam` alone, log `[INFO] --poam implies --remediation; enabling.` and proceed with both. |

### Precedence rule

**Any source flag (`--aws`, `--azure`, `--sharepoint`, `--smb`) means: skip the interactive interview entirely and treat unflagged sources as disabled.** This matches CLI-tool conventions (explicit flags are authoritative; absence means off). If no source flags are present, fall through to the interview in Step 1.

`--repo` on its own counts as a source flag — it triggers the same skip-interview behavior, with all four external sources disabled.

`--no-vuln-scan`, `--no-assessment`, `--no-synthesize`, `--accept-synthesized`, `--remediation`, and `--poam` are output-control flags (they don't affect source selection). They can combine with the interview path or the flag path freely. `--no-assessment` implies `--no-synthesize` (synthesis depends on Findings).

### Examples

| Invocation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| (no args) | Run the interactive interview as today; default `vulnerability_scan.enabled` from config (true unless overridden) |
| `--repo` | Skip interview, repo only, vuln scan on, no remediation, no POAM |
| `--repo --aws` | Skip interview, repo + AWS, vuln scan on, no remediation, no POAM |
| `--repo --no-vuln-scan` | Skip interview, repo only, no vuln scan, no remediation, no POAM |
| `--repo --remediation` | Skip interview, repo only, vuln scan on, auto-remediation, no POAM |
| `--repo --poam` | Skip interview, repo only, vuln scan on, auto-remediation (implied), POA&M generated |
| `--repo --no-assessment` | Skip interview, repo only, no per-sub-control assessment scaffolding (smaller CSV without Result/Findings columns) |
| `--repo --no-synthesize` | Skip interview, repo only, assessment runs but no synthesized drafts written |
| `--repo --accept-synthesized` | Skip interview, repo only, synthesis on, drafts auto-promoted to evidence (loud signaling) |
| `--aws --azure --sharepoint --smb --remediation --poam` | Full external collection + auto-remediation + POAM (no interview) |

## Step 1 — Confirm scope with the user (only when no source flags were passed)

If Step 0 detected any source flag, **skip this step entirely**. The scope is fully determined by flags + config; do not re-ask.

Otherwise, establish which external sources the user wants to scan:

- **Repo only** (first-class default) — no external sources; the agent scans just the current repo.
- **AWS** — requires ambient `aws` CLI auth and `ato-source-aws` sibling installed.
- **Azure** — requires ambient `az` CLI auth and `ato-source-azure` sibling installed.
- **SharePoint / M365** — requires ambient `m365` CLI auth and `ato-source-sharepoint` sibling installed.
- **SMB file shares** — requires mount helpers and `ato-source-smb` sibling installed.

Ask the user which apply. If an `.ato-package.yaml` exists at the repo root, read it and confirm the settings with the user rather than re-asking from scratch.

### SharePoint-specific scope prompts

When SharePoint is enabled (via flag or interactive answer), the scope object MUST include explicit document libraries to scan. SharePoint sites contain one or more libraries (default name `Documents`, plus any others the org has created — `ATO Evidence`, `Compliance`, `Site Assets`, etc.). Scanning only the default library silently misses evidence in non-default libraries — the kind of failure that's invisible until an assessor asks for a document and the package doesn't have it.

Required prompts when `.ato-package.yaml` is missing or has no `libraries:` block:

1. **Tenant** — `Which {tenant}.sharepoint.com tenant? (just the {tenant} label, no scheme)`
2. **Site URL(s)** — `Which SharePoint site(s) hold the ATO evidence? (full URLs, comma-separated)`
3. **Library names per site** — for each site: `Which document library or libraries should be scanned? (comma-separated names — e.g., 'Documents, ATO Evidence, Compliance'; type 'list' to fetch the site's libraries first)`
   - If the user types `list`, run `m365 spo list list --webUrl <site> --output json`, filter to `BaseTemplate == 101`, present the names, and re-prompt.
4. **Optional folder filter per library** — `Restrict to specific folders within <library>? (comma-separated folder paths, or leave blank to scan the entire library)`

The scope object the orchestrator passes to the SharePoint sibling is the new shape (sites + libraries + folders[site][library]); the sibling rejects with `scope_invalid` if libraries are missing.

### Working repo's license / visibility is irrelevant to scope

When SharePoint (or any other external source) is configured, **never** decide whether to skip it based on the working repo's license, visibility, owner, or open-source status. Federal agencies (CMS, NASA, NIH, GSA, USDA) actively operate open-source code that needs ATO; their internal SharePoint typically holds the SSP, IRP, CMP, POA&M, and authorization letters that the package must include. The user's explicit scope wins over any inference about what kind of repo this is.

## Step 2 — Launch the agent

Invoke the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "ato-artifact-collector"`. Pass:

- The confirmed scope (from Step 0 flags or Step 1 interview).
- The repo's working directory.
- The output-control flags resolved in Step 0:
  - `vuln_scan.enabled: true | false` (true unless `--no-vuln-scan` was passed or config disables it)
  - `assessment.enabled: true | false` (config default unless `--no-assessment` was passed; default config is `true`)
  - `synthesis.enabled: true | false` (config default unless `--no-synthesize` was passed; default config is `true`; auto-disabled when `assessment.enabled: false`)
  - `synthesis.auto_accept: true | false` (true if `--accept-synthesized` was passed; default config is `false`)
  - `auto_remediation: true | false` (true if `--remediation` or `--poam` was passed)
  - `auto_poam: true | false` (true if `--poam` was passed)
- Any user notes (target ATO version, deadline, gap tolerance).

The agent's system prompt has the full 8-step workflow (plus the new Step 1.5 vulnerability scan and the post-Step-8 auto-remediation / POA&M follow-ons), Mermaid rules, citation conventions, and sibling-invocation contract.

## Step 3 — Relay the agent's output

When the agent completes, relay:

- Final file tree of `docs/ato-package/` (directories and top-level files only — not contents).
- The `CHECKLIST.md` summary (which items are covered, which are gaps).
- Any scope failures the agent recorded (e.g. SharePoint auth missing — continued without).
- The vulnerability-scan summary table (severity counts + tools missing) if vuln scan ran.
- Confirmation that `REMEDIATION_GUIDANCE.md` and/or `poam-generated.md` exist if those follow-ons ran.

Do not re-process the narrative documents — they are for the assessor, not for summary re-reading in the main conversation.
