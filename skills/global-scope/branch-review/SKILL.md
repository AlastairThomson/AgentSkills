# Branch Review

This skill is a thin stub that triggers on "review branches" / "produce CHANGES.md" requests and delegates to the `branch-review` agent. The agent does the real work and writes `CHANGES.md` at the repo root.

## What to do

1. Invoke the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "branch-review"`. No prompt required beyond stating the working directory context — the agent's system prompt has the full workflow.
2. When the agent returns, relay its recommendation table to the user. The full per-branch detail lives in `CHANGES.md` on disk.
3. Wait for explicit instruction before merging, pruning, or creating PRs. If the user wants to act on multiple PRs at once, hand off to `merge-sprint`.

## Why this is an agent, not inline skill work

`branch-review` reads `git log`, `git diff`, and `gh pr list` output for every unmerged branch in the repo. That output is verbose and one-time; sequestering it in an agent's context keeps the main conversation lean.
